<li><p align="justify">I am a Ph.D student in the <a href="http://www.ece.unm.edu" target="_blank">Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</a> at <a href="http://www.unm.edu" target="_blank">The University of New Mexico, USA</a>, as a member of the Performance and Resource Optimization in Networks (PROTON) Lab, with <a href="http://ece-research.unm.edu/tsiropoulou/index.html" target="_blank">Prof. E. E. Tsiropoulou</a> as an advisor since January 2022. I obtained my Bachelor’s Degree from the <a href="https://www.du.ac.bd/body/APE" target="_blank">Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering</a>, <a href="https://www.du.ac.bd/" target="_blank">University of Dhaka</a>, Bangladesh in March 2020.</p></li>
<li><p align="justify">My research primarily falls under the broad spectrum of Embedded Systems Design with interests in digital circuit design, analog circuit design, electronic systems design along with microcontroller programming, prototyping and testing. My research also involves Computer Systems and Networks, with interests in Resource Orchestration in Interdependent Systems, Heterogeneous Wireless Networks, Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, and Resource Allocation in 6G networks using Game Theory, Optimization Techniques and Reinforcement Learning. In addition, I am also working on developing Alternative Positioning, Navigation and Timing (APNT) services and novel localization techniques. Futhermore, I am focusing my research on a joint domain of APNT and Cybersecurity along with the application of Game Theoretic frameworks.</p></li>
<li><p align="justify">I am also an active student member of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), IEEE Women in Engineering (WIE) Affinity Group and IEEE Special Interests Group on Humanitarian Technology (SIGHT). I have been the Chairperson for <a href="https://ieeesbdu.org/" target="_blank">IEEE Student Branch University of Dhaka (IEEE SB DU)</a> from 2019 to 2021. I received the Best Idea Award at IEEE Bangladesh Section Humanitarian Idea Contest 2017 for the project <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8288898" target="_blank">FoodAlytics: A formalin detection system incorporating a supervised learning approach</a> which was also shortlisted for funding from 409 submissions worldwide at <a href="https://sight.ieee.org/ieee-young-engineers-humanitarian-challenge/" target="_blank">All IEEE Young Engineers’ Humanitarian Challenge (AIYEHUM)</a>, organized by the IEEE Region 10 (Asia-Pacific).</p></li>
